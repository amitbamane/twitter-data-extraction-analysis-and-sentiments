# twitter-data-extraction-analysis-and-sentiments
I have created an insightful notebook that analyzes the social media penetration of none other than Rafael Nadal! I invite you to explore the fascinating world of tweets and sentiments surrounding this tennis legend. 
In this project, I leverage three essential libraries:
Pandas for data analysis,
Tweepy to fetch Twitter data, and
TextBlob to understand the sentiment behind each tweet.
To fetch Twitter data, you'll need a developer account, an app, and a few keys.
It's crucial to clean the tweet data before analysis by removing links, "@" symbols, and special characters. For this, I utilize Python's built-in re library.
In this project, I uncover insightful findings such as:
1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the percentage growth in tweet volume compared to the previous month?
2Ô∏è‚É£ What percentage of tweets exhibit positive sentiments? üòÉ
3Ô∏è‚É£ Let's explore the top 5 most viral tweets based on the number of retweets!
4Ô∏è‚É£ How many influential people are discussing Rafael Nadal? (Those with followers greater than 1000)
5Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, we'll uncover the geographical locations with the highest tweet activity about Rafael Nadal! 
But that's not all! I'll also delve into the most frequently used hashtag, the username with the most tweets, and perform an in-depth analysis of the user with the most tweets.
I am excited to share this notebook with you. You can access it by clicking on the following link: https://lnkd.in/dqvEYiQA
